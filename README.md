# Client-Prototype-Skeleton-React
This is a repository that can be used for prototyping with React.
It is barebones but will make it quick and simple to get a prototype up and running without all the bloat from other projects.

The project uses Gulp and BrowserSync to automatically compile react code along with npm modules and then reload the browser.
Browserify will bundle all front end dependencies.
